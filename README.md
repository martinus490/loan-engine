# Loan Engine

## Project Description
The Loan Engine is a comprehensive application designed to manage the lifecycle of loans. It facilitates the movement of loans through various statesâ€”**Proposed**, **Approved**, **Invested**, and **Disbursed**. Each state has specific rules and requirements that must be adhered to, ensuring a structured and reliable lending process.

- **Disburse a Loan**
